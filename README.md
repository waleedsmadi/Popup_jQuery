# Pop-up in jQuery
A pop-up is a graphical user interface ( GUI ) display area, usually a small window, that suddenly appears ("pops up") 
in the foreground of the visual interface. Pop-ups can be initiated by a single or double mouse click or rollover (sometimes called a mouseover),
and also possibly by voice command or can simply be timed to occur.
A pop-up window must be smaller than the background window or interface; otherwise, it's a replacement interface.
